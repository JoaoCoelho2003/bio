Hello! My name is João Coelho, and I'm excited to kick off this blog as a space to explore and discuss various topics in software engineering.

As someone currently pursuing my master’s in software engineering, I find myself diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and, while my blog will cover a wide range of topics, from software development techniques to industry trends, expect AI to take the spotlight. AI is where I see the future heading, and it’s a field that’s full of possibilities for innovation and discovery.

In this blog, I’ll share my thoughts, research, and learnings, and I hope it’ll serve as both a personal journal and a place for other like-minded individuals to connect. Whether you're a fellow engineer, a student, or simply curious about the world of software and AI, I invite you to join me on this journey.

Stay tuned for posts on everything from machine learning concepts to the ethical challenges of AI, and maybe even some of my personal experiences navigating this ever-evolving field.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the ride!
