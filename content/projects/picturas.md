  # Overview


  This project was developed for the Software Requirements and Architectures course, with the objective of building an image processing and editing platform inspired by popular solutions such as Canva.


  Our team successfully designed and implemented a fully featured platform that includes both the frontend and backend, deployed using **Kubernetes** for scalability and resilience. We also integrated monitoring and observability through **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, ensuring system reliability.


  Beyond core functionality, we implemented a secure authentication system, including login, password reset via email, and support for testing through **MailHog**. To extend functionality, we integrated **Stripe** for payment processing, enabling a premium subscription model. Premium users gain access to advanced image editing tools and exclusive AI-powered features, further enriching the platform’s capabilities.


  # My Contribution


  My primary responsibility was the **frontend development**, where I implemented the user interface using **Vue** and **TypeScript**. In addition, I contributed to the backend, specifically by developing some of the image filter functionalities, and also supported the implementation of the API Gateway to ensure seamless communication between services.


  # What did I learn?


  This was one of the most complete and challenging projects I have participated in so far. By the end, we had built a fully functional application capable of supporting high user demand, which gave me valuable insights into how large-scale systems operate.


  Through this experience, I learned how the different components of a modern application — frontend, backend, infrastructure, monitoring, and third-party integrations — communicate and work together to deliver a reliable platform. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of scalability, security, and observability in real-world software projects.


  # Would I Do Something Differently?


  Yes! Since then, I have pursued the field of Artificial Intelligence with much greater enthusiasm, and I now realize that some of the AI tools we implemented were not as efficient as they could have been. They were computationally intensive and could have produced better outputs with more optimized approaches.


  If I had the chance to revisit the project, I would definitely focus on improving the design and implementation of the AI components. Aside from that, I am extremely satisfied with the final results and would not change much else.
